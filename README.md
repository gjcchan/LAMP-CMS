# LAMP-CMS


This project began in the Summer of 2013 as my foray into web development. The CMS was built on a LAMP stack operating under FreeBSD. The CMS site theme revolves around a eco-friendly computer hardware, and computing. 
The CMS can maintain user accounts and access priviledges, as well inserting new articles onto the site that automatically updates the newsfeed as well as the jQuery banner rotator (with an image that is uploaded by the
user) along with updating and modifying existing articles and moderation reader comments (reader comment box is available at the bottom of every article.)

The site is created using a mix of PHP, HTML, CSS and jQuery. 

This project is merely a learning exercises and is highly unsecure and in no way should it be used to host an actual site.
